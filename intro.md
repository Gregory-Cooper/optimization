# Nonlinear and Stochastic Optimization

Computational optimization is essential to many subdomains of engineering, science, and business such as design, control, operations, supply chains, game theory, data science/analytics, and machine learning.

This course provides a practical introduction to models, algorithms, and modern software for **large-scale numerical optimization**. Topics include (nonconvex) nonlinear programming, deterministic global optimization, integer programming, dynamic optimization, and stochastic programming. Multi-objective optimization and mathematical programs with complementarity constraints may be covered based on time and student interests. The class is design for advanced undergraduate/graduate students from engineering, science, and mathematics who wish to incorporate optimization methods into their research. The course will begin with an introduction to modeling and the Python-based Pyomo computational environment. Optimization theory and algorithms are emphasized.

## What am I going to get out of this class?

At the end of the semester, you should be able to...
- Mathematically formulate optimization problems relevant to your discipline (and research!)
- Program optimization models in Pyomo and compute numerical solutions with state-of-the-art (e.g., commercial) solvers
- Explain the main theory for nonlinear constrained and unconstrained optimization
- Describe basic algorithm elements in pseudocode and implement them in Python
- Analyze results from an optimization problem and communicate key finds in a presentation
- Write and debug 200 lines of Python code using best practices (e.g., publication quality figures, doc strings)
