# Data and Computing for Engineers

Data and computing skills are essential to all subdomains of modern (chemical) engineering, yet many students only receive ad-hoc training in these topics. Instead, **CBE 20258** (undergraudate) and **CBE 60258** (graduate) provides a systematic and rigorous introduction to the fundamentals of i) computing in Python; ii) mathematical modeling; iii) numerical methods for equation solving, integration, and optimization; iv) probability and statistics; and v) data analytics.

## What am I going to get out of this class?

### CBE 20258 (Sophomore)

At the end of the semester, you should be able to...
- **Create mathematical models** and **apply computational methods** to analyze systems using basic principles of chemical engineering (e.g., mass and energy balances, thermodynamic equilibrium, etc.)
- **Analyze data** and **quantify uncertainty** using standard statistical techniques and mathematical models grounded in engineering fundamentals 
- Independently plan, implement, and debug short (100 to 300 lines) **Python computer programs** to analyze data, solve engineering mathematical models, and visualize results

### CBE 40258 (Senior) / CBE 60258 (Graduate)

At the end of the semester, you should be able to...
- **Numerically solve mathematical models** relevant to chemical and biomolecular engineering research
- **Analyze data** and **quantify uncertainty** using modern **data science** (a.k.a., applied statistics) methods
- **Think more critically** demonstrated by independently planning, implementing, and debugging short Python computer programs
- Prepare education modules and **publication quality data visualization**
